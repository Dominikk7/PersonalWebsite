        While working in the robotics engineering design team at Hyfrontier Technologies, I designed and implemented custom machinery and robots for the Hygro product assembly. Their unique assembly process needed custom solutions to be automated while improving quality control. Applying my high school robotics experience and communicating with my mentor, I built two robots and one fixture that automated and optimized this process. For each solution I got the required specifications and researched materials, motion components, controllers, sensors and their cost. I sketched and 3D modeled in Autodesk Inventor to compare and optimize designs. After communicating with the engineers, I assembled, programmed, tested and ensured safety during the robot operation. I gained experience in aligning to design specifications, computer aided design, prototyping, communicating and implementing custom solutions.
