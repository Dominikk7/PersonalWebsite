        I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. 
                            My passions are robotics, computers, programming, and crypto, and my
                            favorite outdoor activity is mountain biking. At UF I am a part of the Polish Student Association, ACM, GAITOR Club
                            and the Machine Intelligence Lab.{'\n\n'}My goal is to work on projects that I enjoy in a team environment. I value
                            otherâ€™s skills as much as my own, and I know with the right team, there are no limits to what can be 
                            accomplished. I hope to work on projects that require developing new solutions to a problem or automating
                            and improving an existing one. I also want to continue to work on my own projects because I like the challenge
                            of creating something by myself and bringing my ideas to life
